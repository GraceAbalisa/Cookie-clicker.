# The  Mission (Team Work)

As a group of 3, we all decided which task we were going to do

We decided to choose Grace as our Git Master,

Her tasks were the following  :

    - Create the Repository
    
    - Send an invitation to each team member
    
    - Merge the "Dev" branch into the "Master" branch.
    
Nathalie is the one that is going to work mainly on the HTML and CSS.

     - Write the base structure for the project
     
Maximilien is working mainly on the javascript
