# The  Mission (Team Work)

As a group of 3, we all decided which task we were going to do

We decided to choose Grace as our Git Master,

Her tasks were the following  :

    - Create the Repository
    
    - Send an invitation to each team member
    
    - Merge the "Dev" branch into the "Master" branch.
    
Nathalie is the one that is going to work mainly on the HTML and CSS.

     - Write the base structure for the project
     
Maximilien is working mainly on the javascript

     - Prepare variables to allow control to button and label
     
     - Ensure that the cookie-clicker respond to the click and the multiple options as increase the score, make and price a multiplier, auto-clicker, bonus , ...
     
   # Creation process
